    <h1>Tall</h1>
    <pre class="he">
        He's got a ticket to the concert, it's the second one this fall
        He's gonna stand there with his phone out and no friends around at all

        He's got a new beer like the first few and he's gonna down it all
        He's on a lookout for a lover who's prepared to risk it all
        just to make him feel tall
    </pre>
    <pre class="she">
        She's got ideas about her fortune, and what she's gonna spend it on
        She's gonna buy herself a symbol to prove that she deserves it all

        She's gonna wear it in the crowd, and on the road, and down the hall
        She's gonna buy a place in heaven for herself and anyone
        who ever made her feel tall
    </pre>
