    <h1>Tall</h1>
    <pre id="concert" class="he">
        He's got a ticket to the concert, it's the second one this fall
        He's gonna stand there with his phone out and no friends around at all

        He's got a new beer like the first few and he's gonna down it all
        He's on the lookout for a lover who's prepared to risk it all
        just to make him feel tall
    </pre>
    <pre id="fortune" class="she" >
        She's got ideas about her fortune, what she's gonna spend it on
        She's gonna buy herself a symbol to prove that she deserves it all

        She's gonna wear it in the crowd, and on the road, and down the hall
        She's gonna buy a place in heaven for herself and anyone
        who ever made her feel tall
    </pre>
    <pre id ="indignation" class="he">
        He's gonna sell his indignation in a pamphlet from a stall
        He's gonna paint himself a hero but he won't answer the call

        He's gonna get himself a ladder to look down upon them all
        And he'll point down to blame the people who haven't worked enough at all
        to escape being small
    </pre>
    <pre id="echo" class="she">
        She's gonna shut the doors around her with a key to keep them out
        She stammers to herself in echoes that she's lost her own way out

        In all the buildings all around her stacked with cells just like her own
        She sees the people building ladders in their arrogance alone
        Maybe it's time to leave home
    </pre>
    <pre id ="ceiling" class="he">
        With a ringing in his ears he picks himself up off the floor
        His brittle ladder lies in splinters strewn around him from the fall

        He gazes up beyond the ceiling he hadn't seen was there at all  ....<!-- more syllables, go to next line... he offers his ladder? -->
    </pre>
    <pre id="outside" class="she">
        <!-- she steps out of her comfort zone -->
        He steps outside and sees a neighbour shivering proudly in the cold
        He goes and gathers up his splinters and sets them on her burning coals
    </pre>
    <pre id="alone" class="she he">
        They've both got tickets to the concert, they were going to go alone
        They're sick of all those phony people who pushed them down to clamber up
        They hold out hope they'll find an equal, someone to help them rise above

       <!--  All of their petty insecurities. <em>Someone who's not afraid to love</em> -->
        <!-- ... -->

    </pre>
